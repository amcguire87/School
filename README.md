Project 2

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.


  This project was to write a program to help people figure out the interest that they would receive over the course of however many years on an initial deposit. It shows the amount without any further deposits and the amount with continuous monthly deposits.

 What did you do particularly well?

 
   I think that the thing that I did well with this project was keeping a lot of the code out of the main function and putting it into classes. It makes main very easy to read and hides the brunt of the coding in the classes so that if you need to modify a particular section of the code you know to modify the class that it is in.

 Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

 
  I could enhance my code by making the classes to be programmed more efficiently. I could make them smaller and easier to read.

 Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

 
  For me, the biggest challenge that I had to overcome was the formatting of the text so that it stayed consistent and looked the same through-out the output of the program. Figuring out what I needed to do in the case of the total account value becoming bigger and shifting the text around was a challenge for me. But through trial and error I was able to figure out what I needed to do and write the if statements for each text size. I probable could have made the code more precise by including it into a switch and implementing different outputs for different cases.

 What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

 
  The ability to encapsulate the brunt of the programming into classes is highly transferable for me because it help to minimize the amount of code that one would have to go through in main to make any modifications to it. If you find an error in the code or wanted to add something to it you would just have to sort through the specific classes that are being implemented for the location that you need to modify. It makes reading main so much easier and makes it so much easier to find where you need to modify the code.

 How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

 
  I made the program maintainable by putting the majority of the programming into classes. This allows someone that was to maintain or modify the code an easier time in locating the section of code that they wish to modify. If you wanted to add another variable for the user to enter you know that you would have to modify the "DisplayTextAndGetInputs.h" file.
